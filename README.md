### About Dataset
We are all aware of how comprehensive machine learning is. Numerous algorithms are accessible and used on a regular basis. Statical approaches of data analysis are very desirable in the field of handling enormous amounts of data. They are analyzed, processed, and framed by data scientists in order to interpret the results and develop a useful plan for the organizations. One such method is the identification of a few independent variables against a single dependent variable using multiple logistic regression.
###Data 
The data we used to create this paper was obtained from the Kaggle website. The dataset is based on the 2013 and 2014 placement results of an unidentified university, whose reference can be found via the aforementioned link.

The dataset includes information on the students' overall academic progress from those years as well as their placement results in relation to that advancement.
